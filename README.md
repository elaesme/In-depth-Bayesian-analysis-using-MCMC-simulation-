# In-depth-Bayesian-analysis-using-MCMC-simulation-

The aim of this project is following these
steps to perform a Bayesian analysis: Illustrating the dataset, explaining the overall features of
the statistical model such as the role of the parameters and the inferential goals of the analysis,
illustrating the main inferential findings (Bayesian point and interval estimation, hypothesis 
testing), discussing one possible alternative statistical model and illustrating results of model
comparison through DIC and/or marginal likelihood and finally, illustration of the features of the
MCMC output, error control, convergence diagnostics.
